## 🐳 Deploy with Docker

You can quickly set up and run BookLore using Docker.

### 1️⃣ Install Docker & Docker Compose

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

**Image Repositories:**
- Docker Hub: `https://hub.docker.com/r/booklore/booklore`
- GitHub Container Registry: `https://ghcr.io/booklore-app/booklore`

> **Note:** Legacy images under `https://ghcr.io/adityachandelgit/booklore-app` will remain available but will not receive new updates.

### 2️⃣ Create docker-compose.yml

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with content:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    # Official Docker Hub image:
    image: booklore/booklore:latest
    # Or the GHCR image:
    # image: ghcr.io/booklore-app/booklore:latest
    container_name: booklore
    environment:
      - USER_ID=0  # Modify this if the volume's ownership is not root
      - GROUP_ID=0 # Modify this if the volume's ownership is not root
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/booklore   # Only modify this if you're familiar with JDBC and your database setup
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=booklore                          # Must match MYSQL_USER defined in the mariadb container
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password              # Use a strong password; must match MYSQL_PASSWORD defined in the mariadb container 
      - BOOKLORE_PORT=6060                                  # Port BookLore listens on inside the container; must match container port below
      - SWAGGER_ENABLED=false                               # Enable or disable Swagger UI (API docs). Set to 'true' to allow access; 'false' to block access (recommended for production).
    depends_on:
      mariadb:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "6060:6060" # HostPort:ContainerPort → Keep both numbers the same, and also ensure the container port matches BOOKLORE_PORT, no exceptions. 
                    # All three (host port, container port, BOOKLORE_PORT) must be identical for BookLore to function properly.
                    # Example: To expose on host port 7070, set BOOKLORE_PORT=7070 and use "7070:7070". 
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/data:/app/data       # Application data (settings, metadata, cache, etc.). Persist this folder to retain your library state across container restarts.
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books:/books         # Primary book library folder. Mount your collection here so BookLore can access and organize your books.
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/bookdrop:/bookdrop   # BookDrop folder. Files placed here are automatically detected and prepared for import.
    restart: unless-stopped

  mariadb:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:11.4.5
    container_name: mariadb
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=super_secure_password  # Use a strong password for the database's root user, should be different from MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=booklore
      - MYSQL_USER=booklore                        # Must match DATABASE_USERNAME defined in the booklore container
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password        # Use a strong password; must match DATABASE_PASSWORD defined in the booklore container
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/mariadb/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mariadb-admin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```
Note: You can find the latest BookLore image tag `BOOKLORE_IMAGE_TAG` (e.g. v.0.x.x) from the Releases section:
📦 [Latest Image Tag – GitHub Releases](https://github.com/adityachandelgit/BookLore/releases)

### 3️⃣ Start the Containers

Run the following command to start the services:

```ini
docker compose up -d
```

### 4️⃣ Access BookLore

Once the containers are up, access BookLore in your browser at:

```ini
http://localhost:6060
```
## 📥 Bookdrop Folder: Auto-Import Files (New)

BookLore now supports a **Bookdrop folder**, a special directory where you can drop your book files (`.pdf`, `.epub`, `.cbz`, etc.), and BookLore will automatically detect, process, and prepare them for import. This makes it easy to bulk add new books without manually uploading each one.

### 🔍 How It Works

1. **File Watcher:** A background process continuously monitors the Bookdrop folder.
2. **File Detection:** When new files are added, BookLore automatically reads them and extracts basic metadata (title, author, etc.) from filenames or embedded data.
3. **Optional Metadata Fetching:** If enabled, BookLore can query metadata sources like Google Books or Open Library to enrich the book information.
4. **Review & Finalize:** You can then review the detected books in the Bookdrop UI, edit metadata if needed, and assign each book to a library and folder structure before finalizing the import.

### ⚙️ Configuration (Docker Setup)

To enable the Bookdrop feature in Docker:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/data:/app/data
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books:/books
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/bookdrop:/bookdrop # 👈 Bookdrop directory
```

## 🔑 OIDC/OAuth2 Authentication (Authentik, Pocket ID, etc.)


BookLore supports optional OIDC/OAuth2 authentication for secure access. This feature allows you to integrate external authentication providers for a seamless login experience.

While the integration has been tested with **Authentik** and **Pocket ID**, it should work with other OIDC providers like **Authelia** as well. The setup allows you to use either JWT-based local authentication or external providers, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred method.

For detailed instructions on setting up OIDC authentication:

- 📺 [YouTube video on configuring Authentik with BookLore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Ufh9ldF9M)
- 📘 [Step-by-step setup guide for Pocket ID](docs/OIDC-Setup-With-PocketID.md)

## 🛡️ Forward Auth with Reverse Proxy

BookLore also supports **Forward Auth** (also known as Remote Auth) for authentication through reverse proxies like **Traefik**, **Nginx**, or **Caddy**. Forward Auth works by having your reverse proxy handle authentication and pass user information via HTTP headers to BookLore. This can be set up with providers like **Authelia** and **Authentik**.
