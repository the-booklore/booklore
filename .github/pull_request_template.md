- [ ] All tests pass locally and output is pasted above
- [ ] Screen recording or screenshots are attached above proving the change works
- [ ] PR is a single focused change (one bug fix OR one feature, not multiple unrelated changes)
- [ ] PR is reasonably scoped (PRs over 1000+ changed lines will be closed, split into smaller PRs)

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Contributions

> **If any part of this PR was generated or assisted by AI tools (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.), all items below are mandatory.** You are fully responsible for every line you submit. "The AI wrote it" is not an excuse, and AI-generated PRs that clearly haven't been reviewed are the #1 reason PRs get closed.

- [ ] I have read and understand every line of this PR and can explain any part of it during review
- [ ] I personally ran the code and verified it works (not just trusted the AI's output)
- [ ] PR is scoped to a single logical change, not a dump of everything the AI suggested
- [ ] Tests validate actual behavior, not just coverage (AI-generated tests often assert nothing meaningful)
- [ ] No dead code, placeholder comments, `TODO`s, or unused scaffolding left behind by AI
- [ ] I did not submit refactors, style changes, or "improvements" the AI suggested beyond the scope of the issue
