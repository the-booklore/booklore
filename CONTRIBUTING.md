## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityachandelgit/BookLore.git
cd booklore
```

---

## 🧱 Local Development Setup

Either run  `docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up` or install & run everything Locally (described below).


### 1. Prerequisites

- **Java 21+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **MariaDB**
- **Docker and Docker Compose**

---

### 2. Frontend Setup

To set up the Angular frontend:

```bash
cd booklore-ui
npm install
ng serve
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4200/`.

> ⚠️ Use `--force` with `npm install` only as a last resort for dependency conflicts.

---

### 3. Backend Setup

#### a. Configure `application-dev.yml`

Create or edit `booklore-api/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`:

```yaml
app:
  path-book: '/path/to/booklore/books'      # Directory for book/comic files
  path-config: '/path/to/booklore/config'   # Directory for thumbnails, metadata, etc.

spring:
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3333/booklore?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
    username: root
    password: Password123
```

> 🔧 Replace `/path/to/...` with actual local paths

#### b. Run the Backend

```bash
cd booklore-api
./gradlew bootRun
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Frontend

Run unit tests using:

```bash
